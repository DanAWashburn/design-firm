For this project, I would like to build a real website. A friend of mine is a professional historian, needs a website, and has asked me to build it for her. I propose using this assignment as the means to do so.

Her hopes for the website tend to skew towards either "pretty easy" or "quite challenging." I'd like to end the quarter with a good, functioning, published version of the site that has at least taken care of all the easy aspects and has come as close as possible to the challenging ones.

The audience for the website is twofold-- my friend herself and users trying to find out more about her. It's odd that the client is the user but in this case, she's been clear that this is the way it is.

Thus the "topic" of this website is the historian herself. My reason for doing it is to build my portfolio with actual work. Her reasons for generating it are to make her professional profile cleaner and to do demonstrate data related to housing patterns more visibly clear.

She specializes in Baltimore, in particular the patterns of housing and race. The data necessary for the website is all data that she has created. The website will not need to get information from, say, the Baltimore County Office of Records. For this reason, I'm not certain that an API will be necessary in the website. However, I would be happy to build a dummy page that uses an API if that's an important task. For example, it could use the District of Columbia Open Data. It's not quite the right city, but it's close. Additionally, the website should link to her Twitter account. I don't think this requires an API but if it does, that would be one place an API could come into play (however, the Twitter API is expensive).

One technical challenge to the website is that the client would like it to include interactive maps. Of course, it would be great to end the quarter with a full version of the maps. If this isn't possible, I'd like to create something by the end of the quarter that has worked out all of the technical challenges. Perhaps this would be a simplified version of one map that has two or three points of interaction. From there, I could add complexity to the functioning template so that there are more maps and they contain more details.

Another challenge is that the client is definitely thinking of the website in its desktop version. We will need to think about what the mobile and tablet versions would look like. We're certainly in the realm of graceful degradation; certain features may need to be disabled for the small-screen version of the site.
